== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will there ever be more options added? =

Yes, I do have plans on adding more options for this plugin. For instance, I plan on adding a page in the WordPress admin panel for you to be able to edit the CSS so the author box can be styled to fit with your theme design. I also would like to remove some of the default user info (ie: AIM name, etc) and replace those with Twitter, Facebook and Google+.

= What are the default CSS codes? =

You can copy/paste the below css codes into your themes CSS file and adjust them accordingly.

	.guerrillawrap { float: left; width: 96%; padding: 2%; background: #f8f8f8; }
	.guerrillagravatar { float: left; margin: 0 10px 0 0; }
	.guerrillatext { }
	.guerrillatext h4 { margin: 0 0 10px 0; }
